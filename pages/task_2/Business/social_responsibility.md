# As well as making money, businesses also have a responsibility towards society.To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Essay:

These days, business enterprises achieve such great high returns from their potential commercial activities. Besides, each commercial firm has its obligation toward the community. From my perspective, these firms are responsible for serving society in the economic and environmental sectors and humanity.

Those advocates say businesses are held accountable for shrinking the unemployment rate since the surplus of employees declined job offers. Several firms were said to over-exploit workers for cheap labor; thus, they rejected employment due to being offered under average monthly salary. By adjusting working hours and salary, these firms might provide job opportunities with higher-paid labor for the residents that entail the balance of employment rate. Second, several revenue-generating innovations from young entrepreneurs need investing by these commercial firms. Beyond the potential opportunities for high returns, as a social obligation, these enterprises are responsible for fostering the talent of the younger generation by supporting their ideas. 

Not only serve the interests of several sections of society, such as employees and the community, but businesses are also involved in the practices of environmental protection. A firm’s social obligation towards the environment, even if not covered by laws, is undeniable as the remains from commercial activities, such as waste materials, might ruin the natural habitats and put an end to numerous wild animal lives. 

In conclusion, the top priority of most businesses is the bottom line of their trading and commercial activities. However, firms’ contribution to the community at large is essential to maintain economic sustainability, motivate new generations, and intact the physical appearance of the wildlife.
