These days, animal testing is vital for research laboratories to develop medical treatments for human beings.
Though some people affirmed their belief in animal rights and against the experiments on animals, others emphasized the importance of animal testing in destining human medical use.


Advocates of animal experiments say that animal testing puts importance on human-saving cures and treatments.
Since animal testing is a process by which researchers experiment with medicines on animals such as rats, mice, or rabbits; thus, medical scientists enable to determine the efficiency of these products on humans.
For example, during the coronavirus pandemic, people around the world have been vaccinated, resulting from numerous animal testing cases.
Second, there is no adequate alternative to testing on a living and whole-body system since only animals are living beings similar to humankind to some extent.
For example, testing on living things such as chimpanzees brings several positive results when evaluating drugs since these animals have similar genes to human beings.


Opponents, however, with their beliefs on animal rights, consider animal testing inhuman actions towards living beings.
Animals used in experiments are frequently under conditions such as water deprivation, overfeeding, or even the infliction of burns to study their healing process.
Moreover, there is an increasing demand for animal testing during the virus pandemic, driving to several terrible animal abuse cases.
