These days, the presence of public art has become increasingly familiar; thus, urban communities should execute more artworks under government spending to provide residents with better places to settle down.
From my perspective, I support the idea of building more artwork for several reasons.

Public art denotes any work of art which is designed to be accessible to public space.
Those favors say that this art form might enrich the physical environments since artworks represent the appearance of the inward and outward urban areas.
The purpose of artworks is to gather people’s attention and captivate the viewers as artists make art; thus, these artworks might enhance the urban landscapes.
Moreover, art in the public realm might be a tool for community building and storytelling or fostering its cultural identity since every artwork represents its sense of meaning and identification to its residents.

Some people believe that works of art might create a supportive learning environment.
Since it amplifies the residents' awareness of the art, viewers are encouraged to be more creative and critical of the messages from these artworks; thus, it contributes to educating people about the value of art.

The presence of artworks in the urban sites might gather tourists’ attention, thus increasing the bottom line in the tourism industry.
