# The Role of Art in Society

Art is considered an essential part of all cultures throughout the world.
However, these days fewer and fewer people appreciate art and turn their focus to science, technology, and business.
Why do you think that is? What could be done to encourage more people to take interest in the arts? 

**Essay:**

Works of art have enriched the appearance of the local community and identified its cultural identity.
However, the global number of aesthetes enthused in the art will likely shrink as humans are more engaged with science, technology, and business innovations.
There are several reasons behind this phenomenon; thus, some given ways to inspire artworks in humans are provided from my perspective.

The first reason is that the importance of art in school is understated since art is not considered as valuable as academic subjects such as Mathematics and Science.
For example, art education was dropped from some Vietnamese curriculums to encourage students to be more focused on other subjects.
Second, works of art might not cure humans’ souls as before since there are numerous forms of entertainment comforting them.
For instance, after long hours at work or school, some preferred turning into movie-goers to exploring museums and art exhibitions.

Since art represents the physical environment of the local community, both inward and outward,  art should be enthused by more and more people.
First, creative artworks from talented artists should be subsidized by the government and local council.
Art performances might only survive if the government provided financial support for the art owners.
Therefore, local communities should invite local artists to share their talents on the city's streets during special events such as farmers' markets or festivals.
Second, promoting art exhibitions in public spaces like parks, libraries, and museums should not be underestimated.
The local councils might promote art appreciation by encouraging more public art in urban sites or city centers to attract many people’s attention.
